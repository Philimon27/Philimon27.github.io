Exercise 2

   2.1 Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
   Solution:

   Main  advantage of setImmediate over setTimeout is that setImmediate will always be executed  before any timers if scheduled with an i/o  cycle,independently of howmany timers are present.

   2.2 Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
   Solution:

   Process.nextTick is used to schedule a callback function to be invoked in the next iteration of the event loop. 
   setImmediate mehod is used to execute a function  right after the current event loop finishes
